## Version 3: Value Proposition Format

**"What if you could ask your finances any question and get an intelligent answer? 'Am I overspending?' 'How much runway do I have?' 'What should I do differently?'

## Version 4: Comparison Format

**"You know Mint? It shows you where your money went. You know ChatGPT? It answers questions. RayyAI combines both: it shows you your finances AND answers questions about them using YOUR actual data. Ask 'What's my biggest expense category?' or 'Create a $500 groceries budget'—and it just works, powered by AI that understands your complete financial picture."**

RayyAI responds: 'You're spending 15% more on dining out. You have 12 days of runway before hitting your budget. I recommend reducing restaurant visits by 30% to stay on track.' That's RayyAI—intelligent, personalized, actionable."**
