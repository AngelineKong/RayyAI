## 📊 The Problem (1 minute)

**The Financial Management Gap:**

- **Information Overload**: People have transactions across multiple accounts, credit cards, and payment methods, but no unified view
- **Lack of Context**: Traditional apps show numbers but don't explain *why* you're spending or *how* to improve
- **Reactive, Not Proactive**: Most tools tell you what happened, not what *will* happen or what you *should* do
- **Generic Advice**: Financial guidance is one-size-fits-all, ignoring your unique situation, goals, and cultural context
- **Manual Work**: Uploading statements, categorizing transactions, and tracking budgets is tedious and error-prone

**The Result?** People make financial decisions in the dark, miss opportunities to save, and struggle to achieve their goals.
